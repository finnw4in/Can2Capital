# Can 2 Capital: A Decentralised Digital Kit

**Can 2 Capital** is a decentralised digital kit that enables anyone and everyone to turn waste aluminium cans into something valuable that can be sold, traded, or kept.

---

## How Does It Differ?

Can 2 Capital differs from traditional industrial aluminium recycling as it seeks to return **profit to the user**, not the producer.

---

## How It Works

1. **Collect** waste aluminium cans.
2. **Use the Can 2 Capital kit** (requires 100 Joules of human effort, 50g PETG, and a carbide insert) to process the can.
3. **Create** a valuable output (e.g., ingot, part, or digital token).
4. **Sell, trade, or keep** your output—profit goes directly to you!
